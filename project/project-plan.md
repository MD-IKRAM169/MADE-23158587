# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Exploring the Link Between Carbon Dioxide Emissions and Global Food Security.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Is there a correlation between a country's carbon dioxide emissions and its food production levels?

2. Do countries with higher CO2 emissions experience lower or higher crop yields per unit of land area?

3. Which countries produce the most food per unit of CO2 emitted (essentially measuring food production efficiency)?

4. Based on current trends in CO2 emissions and food production practices, can we predict future impacts on global food security?

5. Are there any geographical patterns in carbon dioxide emissions that correlate with specific climate zones?


## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The main objective of this project is to study the connection between carbon dioxide emissions and food production of a country. We'll analyze two datasets: one that consists of CO2 emissions per country and another that encompasses food production data, including land use for agriculture.

Climate change, which is caused by greenhouse gases such as CO2, is a major danger to food security worldwide. This project intends to explore the ways in which a country's emissions may affect its food production capacity. By studying the relationships and possible tendencies, we can reveal which countries are most vulnerable and where the emissions reduction could be crucial for preserving food production.

The project will include data cleaning, combining the two datasets for each country, and looking for potential associations between emissions and food production metrics. We could also use visualization to show these connections and perhaps use statistical modeling to calculate the impact of emissions on food production.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Data on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Our World in Data
* Metadata URL:  https://github.com/owid/co2-data/blob/master/owid-co2-codebook.csv
* Data URL: https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/owid-public/data/co2/owid-co2-data.csv
* Data Type: CSV

The dataset contains a comprehensive record of carbon dioxide emission rates in metric tons per capita across various countries spanning the years 1850 to 2022. This wealth of information enables detailed analysis and understanding of the trends and patterns in carbon emissions on a global scale over the past three decades. By examining this data, researchers can identify countries with consistently high or low emission rates, pinpoint periods of significant increases or decreases in emissions, and assess the effectiveness of policies and initiatives aimed at mitigating carbon emissions.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource2: FAOSTAT
* Metadata URL: https://www.fao.org/home/en
* Data URL: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL
* Data Type: CSV

The dataset offers an extensive record of food production by land area utilization and total output for every country worldwide from 1990 to 2022. This comprehensive collection of data provides invaluable insights into global agricultural trends, enabling researchers and policymakers to analyze and understand patterns in food production over the past three decades. By examining this dataset, researchers can identify countries with significant agricultural output, assess the efficiency of land use in food production, and track changes in production levels over time.
